# Nation of Makers Website


## Purpose

A website which communicates the mission, vision, and values of the Nation of Makers.


## Contributing

**NOTE: Currently, the website is in a temporary content freeze as we form the official organization. Contributions are still welcome but major content/copy changes may not get approved until the transition occurs. Thanks for understanding! ðŸ¤“**

Pick whichever of the following two contribution methods fits your style.

If you need any help with any of this, please jump into the &#35;nom_website channel in the NOM slack; we're here to help.

*A side note to git pros: We're working on the master branch during
build mode to simplify the process for contributors.


## Contributing via CLI

   You know the drill.  
   
   If you don't know or don't want to mess with all that, then see the
   next section.
   
   If you do want to learn how to use git and github via the CLI, then
